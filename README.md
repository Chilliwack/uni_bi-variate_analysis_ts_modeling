# uni_bi-variate_analysis_ts_modeling

**uni_bi-variate_analysis_ts_modeling** shows some work I was doing back in 2016 using website data to cover..

1. Define the business question that you would like to answer with data? _As a planner/forecaster how can I leverage this data?_
2. Define the ideal data set (ie the data set that you would collect if time and money were no object) _A dataset that contains the media spend, media results, website data & e-comm data_
3. Determine what data you can access - _TM_US_incremental_web_order_raw_data.xlsx_
4. Obtain the data
5. Clean the data
6. Exploratory data analysis (understand the quirks of the particular data)

Data Exploration Process:

    1. Variable Identification
    2. Univariate Analysis - explore variables one by one Central Tendency and Measure of Dispersion
    3. Bi-variate Analysis - finds out the relationship between two variables
    4. Missing values treatment
    5. Variable transformation
    6. Outlier treatment
    7. Variable creation

7. Statistical prediction/modeling (perform statistical prediction or modeling to answer the business question) - Time Series forecasting (prediction) - Test the accuracy of the results
8. Interpret results (so that you can tell people in plain language what the statistical models or predictions mean)
9. Challenge results (explain to people what the potential failings of the model are so they are able to make informed decisions)
10. Synthesize/write up results telling a story about the data that attempts to answer the question
11. Create reproducible code
